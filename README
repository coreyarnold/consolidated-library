This project is the beginnings of an attempt to produce a media library style pluging for wordpress. Myself and friends
have many books, video games, dvds, board/card games, etc. and would like a way to easily keep track of them. This
includes being able to look them up from our smartphones when in a store, or to send a link to a family member so
they can see what we've already got when they are looking to buy presents for example.

Some good examples include:
Mac App - Delicious Library 2
