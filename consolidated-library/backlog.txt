General thoughts.
Construct the lists as a generic list of items. Making items and extending them into books, video games, movies, etc. will allow us to reuse a lot of the similar characteristics (title, purchase price, rating, etc.) while still allowing us to add specific properties such as platform, format (dvd, blu-ray), etc.
 
It might be good to kind of bootstrap the collection by importing a CSV or XML file from some other application/system. Long term we need to think about entry. It would be awesome to be able to use a webcam to scan barcodes!


make the content visible only when logged in
make the entry as easy/complicated as somebody wants. just UPC, maybe a manual mode with just the essentials, etc.
